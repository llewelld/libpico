The Pico project is liberating humanity from passwords. See https://www.mypico.org.

Libpico provides a library for performing server-side Pico pairing and authentication.

## Documentation

For more details on the libpico API, how to build the packages and so on, see:

https://docs.mypico.org/developer/libpico/

## Install

If you have autoconf you should be able to install using the following 3 commands:

```
./configure
make
make install
```

However, we recommend you build the deb or rpm package instead. See the developer docs for details about how to do this.
