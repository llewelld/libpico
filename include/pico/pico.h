 * @brief Main public header needed for libpico use
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The pico.h header file is intended as the main public header for libpico.
 * It's just a wrapper header and should pull in the other headers needed
 * to use libpico (in theory; in practice you currently have to pull in 
 * individual header files).
 *
 * There is no assocated pico.c file
