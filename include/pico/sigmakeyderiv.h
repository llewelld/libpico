 * @brief Generate shared secrets from ECDH keys
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The SharedSigmaKeyDerivclass takes a ECDH-generates shared secret and uses
 * it to generate a bundle more shared secrets for use in other parts of the
 * Sigma-I protocol (for the ECDH generation approach, see the KeyAgreement
 * class).
 *
 * The approach is based on the key derivation protocol used in Internet Key 
 * Exchange (IKE), as specified in RFC 4306 and NIST SP 800-135
 * http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4306#section-2.13
 * csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-135-rev1/sp800-135-rev1.pdfâ€Ž
 * 
 * In the randomness extraction step, the key derivation key is derived by 
 * taking the SHA256 HMAC of the shared secret obtained using a prior
 * public-key-based key agreement procedure, where the key to the HMAC is
 * $N_P || N_S$ where $N_P$ is the nonce sent by the Pico and $N_S$ is the 
 * nonce sent by the service.
 * 
 * In the key expansion step, each block of key material is derived using a 
 * SHA256 HMAC. The key to the HMAC is the key deriving key, and the message 
 * for block $k$, $B_k$$, is $B_{k - 1} || k || N_P || N_S$, except for the 
 * first block, where the previous block component is ommitted.
